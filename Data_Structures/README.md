# Data_Structures
 
In this folder, you will find the implementation of the most used data structures for interview purposes. Starting from Linked List, Double Linked List, Binary Tree, Tries, etc.
Also, you will find the top questions that can be asked realted to each data structure along with their solutions.

| Description  | File |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Single Linked List with its questions (without getters and setters)  | Content Cell  |
| Single Linked List with its questions (with getters and setters)  | Content Cell  |
| Double Linked List | Content Cell  |
| Binary Search tree (BST) | Content Cell  |
| Balanced Binary Search Tree | Content Cell  |
| Most important questions for BST | Content Cell  |
| Helpful function to print Binary Tree as it looks | Content Cell  |
| Trie 1 | Content Cell  |
| Trie 2 | Content Cell  |


In Code folder, there are the files: [Graphs.py](https://github.com/Gharibim/Algorithms_Data_Structures/blob/master/Algorithms/Code/graphs.py) which contains the most used graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, cycle detection, Topological sort, strongly connected components, and others.</br>
All these algorithms were implemented once using linked list and once using adjacency matrix.</br></br>

The other file [arrays_strings.py](https://github.com/Gharibim/Algorithms_Data_Structures/blob/master/Algorithms/Code/arrays_strings.py) contains the top questions that were asked on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and other similar websites such as [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These questions require different algorithm implementations such as searching, sorting, ranking, etc.
