# Algorithm Questions

In this folder, there are two files: [Graphs.py](https://github.com/Gharibim/Algorithms_Data_Structures/blob/master/Algorithms/Code/graphs.py) which contains the most used graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, cycle detection, Topological sort, strongly connected components, and others.</br>
All these algorithms were implemented once using linked list and once using adjacency matrix.</br></br>

The other file [arrays_strings.py](https://github.com/Gharibim/Algorithms_Data_Structures/blob/master/Algorithms/Code/arrays_strings.py) contains the top questions that were asked on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and other similar websites such as [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These questions require different algorithm implementations such as searching, sorting, ranking, etc.
